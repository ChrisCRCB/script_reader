Honeymoon Suite


Cast
‘Something Old, Something New’
• Porter Irish, a wise old ‘fool’.
• Jet A middle-aged rocker.
• Pat 35, smart, quick-witted, PA to Jet.


Porter enters carrying two large cases, followed by Jet and Pat. Jet is wearing all black gear; an open black shirt 
with a gold medallion, black leather trousers (too tight) and a long black coat slung over his shoulders. He has a 
long blonde wig with hair down to his waist. Pat is wearing a light pastel coloured mini-skirted suit, with a large 
straw hat.
Porter I don’t believe it. Wait till I tell the kids … Jet Rush. Times I’ve seen you on Pop of the Tops.
Jet Top of the Pops.
Porter Right. Many a time. Don’t tell me … 1967 … “Hey, shake it and a roll it!”.
Jet You got it.
Porter And I’ll tell ya how I know that? That was the year we had our Seamus. The wife’s idea … 
the name. Never liked it myself. I wanted Elvis. Anyway, soon as he popped out I was down 
the record shop buying it.
Jet A fan.
Porter And tell me if I’m wrong, but didn’t it reach the top twenty.
Jet Close enough.
Porter (Singing, out of tune) “Hey, shake it and a roll it! / Shake it and a roll it! / Shake it and a roll it, 
now!”. (Jet hands him a tip). Oh, ta very much. Very kind, Mr Rush. (He points to the bathroom 
door). The loo, sauna and …
Jet I think we can find our own way around.
Porter Fair enough. Now, anything you need … anything … give me a bell. Francis. I’m always 
around the desk. You name it, I got it, you know what I mean?
Jet We’ll do that.
Porter Can’t get over it. I saw you on the telly on the one o’clock news.
Jet Did you?
Porter Terrible scrum that was; cameras practically poking your eyes out. I couldn’t be doing with 
that.
Jet You get used to it. Look, Francis, you can do me one favour. (He hands over another tip).
Porter Anything at all. Anything.
Jet Don’t let anyone know I’m here. Got it?
Porter Got it.
Jet Papers! You know what they’re like.
Porter Do I.
Jet Anything for a scoop.
Porter Vultures.
Jet All I want is peace and quiet.
Porter And that’s what you shall have … you and your good wife here. As far as I’m concerned, I 
don’t know who you are. Jet Rush doesn’t exist. I’ve never heard of Jet Rush. “Jet Rush? 
Who’s he?” How’s that?
Jet Too much.
Porter Too ...?
Jet Too much. No need to go over the top. If any reporters ring, all you say is, “He’s not here!” 
End of story.
Porter Got it! “He’s not here”. That’ll do it. That’ll throw them off the scent.
Jet And I warn you now, Francis....
Porter Yes sir! What’s that, sir?
Jet They’ll try dropping a few carrots in your lap. You could make a packet.
Porter Or an Irish Stew, is that not a … no.
Jet You know what I’m saying?
Porter Of course, sir, I do. I do! Carrots might take in a donkey, but not me. You’re not here … 
that’s an end to it.

Jet Good.
Porter Avarice, get thee behind me. “What’s the use of worldly wealth if you don’t have self 
respect”, as my old priest used to say.
Jet Exactly.
Porter “Wealth is not what you hold in your hand, but what is contained in the soul”.
Jet Right on.
Porter “One gold coin won’t squeeze you through the gates of heaven”, and, as Father Muldoon 
used to say, if …
Jet Francis! Say no more. I’m convinced. I know I can rely on you.
Porter That you can, sir. Rest in peace … or … keep cool, as you’d say. Bye for now.
Exit Porter. Pat goes to the drinks cabinet.
Pat I need something strong.
Jet (Picking up the phone) Outside line! (He dials). Jacky! We’re all set up. Get the circus rolling! 
(Pause). Yep! There’s a geezer called Francis … a porter. Give his name. My guess he’ll do 
anything for a Guinness. (Pause). Don’t take too long. This fresh air’s gettin’ to me. We want 
to be out of here by tonight. See ya! (He replaces the phone).
Pat Does sire require some liquid refreshment?
Jet Get me a soda water. My guts are playing up.
Pat You’re nervous.
Jet I’m not nervous. Concerned, worried, anxious … but not nervous.
Pat You’re nervous. You’re always the same. I know you.
Jet You know me? You think you know me.
Pat I should know you, after all I’ve only been your secretary for the last fifteen years.
Jet You don’t know me, no-one knows me, even I don’t know me.
Pat Whatever you say.
Jet And don’t do that.
Pat What?
Jet Patronise me.
Pat I …
Jet You always do that. You always say that: “Whatever you say”! It gets right up my nose.
Pat Sorry for talking.
Jet And that.
Pat What?
Jet “Sorry for talking”. That’s another one. Any sign I’m losing my cool you come out with 
“Whatever you say”, or “Sorry for talking”. And don’t call yourself a secretary. You are not a
secretary. You can’t type; you can’t take shorthand. You’re not a secretary.
Pat So, what am I?
Jet You’re a PA; ‘Girl Friday’.
Pat You mean general dogsbody.
Jet Whatever fits.
Pat After fifteen years I get a job description. Is that: Dogsbody first class, or second class? That’s 
all you think of me, isn’t it? That’s the sort of respect I get.
Jet Don’t get your knickers in a twist.
Pat I follow you around at concerts with soda water and Motillium …
Jet Here we go.
Pat I make sure you get the right diet, I answer your mail, I collect your laundry, I arrange 
appointments, I even drive your car when you’re drunk. But that does not mean I’m a 
dogsbody. I don’t come when you whistle. (She hands him a soda water). Look at your hands. 
You’re nervous. In your position, I’d be nervous. Anyone would be nervous. It’s natural to be 
nervous.
Jet Will you stop saying that word.
Pat If my career was going down the tube I’d be … concerned.
Jet Down the tube? Get one thing straight. This marriage is purely a business arrangement. 
That’s it. Nothing more. So don’t start spinning any wifely homespun advice. That’s not in 
the deal.
Pat And now you’re angry.
Jet I am not angry. I’m stating the facts of life. That is not anger.
Pat You sound angry to me. Then you always did have a short fuse. Everyone knows that.
Jet That a fact?
Pat Fact.
Jet You’d know if I was angry … I promise.
Pat Recently you’ve been angry at least once every day without fail.
Jet Perhaps that says something about the morons who hang around me, day in day out.
Pat Am I included in that?
Jet Let’s say you play your part.
Pat And let’s say, to put up with your … peculiar behaviour day in day out, requires the patience 
of a saint.
Jet (Knocking back his drink) When this fiasco is over you won’t have to put up with my ‘peculiar 
behaviour’ any more. (He hands the glass back to Pat).
Pat I get the strong impression you don’t want to consummate this marriage.
Jet Spot on.
Pat Suits me.
Jet Good. We agree about something.
Pat Good! (Pause). I’ll go my way, you go yours. (She returns the glass to the cabinet).
Jet Absolutely.
Pat Neat.
Jet Clean. (Pause). What peculiar behaviour?
Pat Pardon? Are you talking to me? Shouldn’t you be whistling or clicking your fingers or 
something?
Jet I said, what peculiar behaviour?
Pat Is there any point in talking? Is there?
Jet What else can we do? We could be stuck here for hours.
Pat You ask me what peculiar behaviour … I tell you … you deny it; we argue, then silence … 
and your silences are monumental as you well know. So let’s take a short cut. Keep it silent.
Jet Shall I tell you something? I argue more with you than with anyone else I know.
Pat No-one else has the balls to face up to you.
Jet That a fact?
Pat Not only that, no-one else would have put up with you for fifteen years.
Jet Don’t kid yourself. One ad in ‘The Stage’ … they would have been lined up.
Pat Dream on!
Jet Could have got rid of you years ago.
Pat Ha!
Jet Ha! … Ha, ha, ha!
Pat I must have been crazy. Why did I save your arse so many times?
Jet You were well paid.
Pat Scraps!
Jet Well paid.
Pat Remember Berlin?
Jet Perhaps I don’t understand Germanic humour.
Pat Goose stepping around the stage was not funny, Jet.
Jet That was purely spontaneous.
Pat And the Carnegie Hall riot? Was that spontaneous too?
Jet That was a political statement about black repression.
Pat I know that’s what you told the papers. From where I was standing it was simply you flashing 
your backside at the public.
Jet Got me on the front page didn’t it?
Pat And into jail.
Jet Didn’t mind the old nick. Gave me a bit of street cred.
Pat I went through a week of hell getting you out of that place. They really were trying to sew 
you up.
Jet You’re a martyr.
Pat I saved you from the wolves and you give me scraps. Then I suppose that’s what you give 
dogs, scraps.
Jet You’re breaking my heart.
Pat If it hadn’t been for me you would have been washed up years ago … on the scrap heap with 
all the rest of the plastic geriatric teenagers.
Jet Is there one ounce of plastic on my body? Can you see plastic? Can you? No! What you see 
is what you get.
Pat Only don’t get too close.
Jet I don’t mind close ups.
Pat You should.
Jet They can put the lens right up my nose. I’ve got nothing to hide.
Pat Only wrinkles.
Jet I haven’t got wrinkles.
Pat They’re everywhere. And crows feet.
Jet Where? (He goes to the mirror).
Pat Under the eyes. Where else?
Jet Rubbish! They’re laughter lines, that’s all they are.
Pat Then you’d better keep smiling. (Jet smiles at himself and then pulls a straight face to see the 
difference. He does this in quick succession several times). How old are you, Jet? (Pause). See that! 
You can’t face it. Your eyes glazed over. I could see your brain working overtime, “What do I 
say? What can I get away with?”.
Jet I’m forty-two. Satisfied?
Pat And the rest. You’re fifty-one. And don’t try to deny it. I saw your birth certificate in the 
Registry Office. Yes. Thought I hadn’t noticed didn’t you.
Jet I don’t give a toss what you saw. In here I’m nineteen. That’s what counts. (He takes a final 
look in the mirror). A few lines give character.
Pat Whatever you say.
Jet A rugged look … masculine.
Pat I’m all for it. Perhaps you could get a few pockmarks grafted on. Go for it. The older look’s 
in.
Jet I’m not ready for the older look.
Pat You’re not alone, you know. The business is full of big kids like you. They don’t know when 
to hang up their platform soles.
Jet When “The Best Of Jet” comes out this year, you’ll see. You’ll see who’s over the hill or not. 
It’s going to be big. You’ll see.
Pat Will I?
Jet I’ve seen ‘em come and go. Can’t stand the pace most of ‘em. Overnight success, one hit, 
then they’re off. No quality. The punters know when they see my name, I give ‘em what they 
want. Good old rock and roll.
Pat Right! It’s old.
Jet It’s old, it’s good, it’s basic, it’s raw, it’s me. I don’t hide behind synths and back-tracking.
