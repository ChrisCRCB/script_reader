When I was a lad of eighteen, our King died in London and left no one to succeed him;
only a sword stuck through an anvil which stood on a stone.
Written on it in letters of gold it said:
"Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil is rightwise King bom of all England."
Many chaps tried to dislodge it, and none could.
Finally a great tournament was proclaimed for New Year's Day, so that all the mightiest knights in England would be assembled at one time to have a go at the sword.
I went to London as squire to my cousin, Sir Kay.
The morning of the tournament, Kay discovered he'd left his sword at home and gave me a shilling to ride back to fetch it.
On my way through London, I passed a square and saw there a sword rising from a stone.
Not thinking very quickly, I thought it was a war memorial.
The square was deserted, so I decided to save myself a journey and borrow it.
I tried to pull it out. I failed. I tried again. I failed again.
Then I closed my eyes and with all my force tried one last time.
Lo, it moved in my hand. Then slowly it slid out of the stone.
I heard a great roar. When I opened my eyes, the square was filled with people shouting:
"Long live the King! Long live the King!" Then I looked at the sword and saw the blade gleaming with letters of gold.
That's how I became King. I never knew I would be. I never wanted to be.
And since I am, I have been ill at ease in my crown.
Until I dropped from the tree and my eye beheld you.
Then suddenly, for the first time, I felt I was King. I was glad to be King.
And most astonishing of all, I wanted to be the wisest, most heroic, most splendid King who ever sat on any throne.
If you will come with me, Milady, I will arrange for the carriage to return you to your father.
