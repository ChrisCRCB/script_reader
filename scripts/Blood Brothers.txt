I wish I was our Sammy
Our Sammy's nearly ten.
He's got two worms and a catapult
An' he's built a underground den.
But I'm not allowed to go in there,
I have to stay near the gate,
Cos me mam says I'm only seven,
But I'm not, I'm nearly eight!
I sometimes hate our Sammy,
He robbed me toy car ya know,
Now the wheels are missin' an' the top's broke off,
An' the bleedin' thing won' go.
An' he said when he took it, it was just like that,
But it wasn't, it went dead straight,
But ya can't say nottin when they think ya seven
An' ya not, ya nearly eight.
I wish I was our Sammy,
Ya wanna see him spit,
Straight in ya eye from twenty yards
An every time a hit.
He's allowed to play with matches,
And he goes to bed dead late,
And I have to go at seven,
Even though I'm nearly eight.
Ya know our Sammy,
He draws nudey women,
Without arms, or legs, or even heads
In the baths, when he goes swimmin.
But I'm not allowed to go to the baths,
Me mam says I have to wait,
Cos I might get drowned, cos I'm only seven,
But I'm not, I'm nearly eight.
Ya know our Sammy,
Ya know what he sometimes does?
He wees straight through the letter box
Of the house next door to us.
I tried to do it one night,
But I had to stand on a crate,
Cos I couldn't reach the letter box 
But I will by the time I'm eight.
